# PlexMediaPlayer

This is a **Control Only** profile for the new Plex Media Player for Savant Home Automation systems.

I am currently looking into methods of getting feedback from the new player. However I feel like the player is not quite adhearing to the API specifications set by Plex yet. For a full brief on the Plex API pelase see the [Plex API Documentation](https://github.com/plexinc/plex-media-player/wiki/Remote-control-API)

At this point, the control API for Plex Media Player is quite limited compared to Plex Home Theatre - which was based on Kodi, and was able to make full use of its awesome API. With this new player from Plex however, they have built it from the ground up using all their own code. This means that they are also writing their own API. Lets hope the API will improve over time.

Currently, Pelx Media Player is only available to Plex Pass members only. So if you have a plex pass you can download your copy of the new player from [Plex's Website](https://plex.tv/downloads?channel=plexpass)
